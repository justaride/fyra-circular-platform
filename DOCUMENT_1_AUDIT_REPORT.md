**TIER 3 TACTICAL SUPPLIERS (SITUATIONAL):**
5. REKOMO - Budget backup, fast delivery
6. PLACE2PLACE - Boutique/unique pieces
7. BRATTÖNS (Göteborg), MALMÖ ÅTERBYGGDEPÅ - Regional building materials

#### GEOGRAPHIC DEPLOYMENT MATRIX

Detailed table showing:
- Stockholm: YLLW (Dalby) + Input (Stockholm HQ) primary, Rekomo secondary, Återbruksfabriken building materials
- Göteborg: YLLW + Input primary, Rekomo (Göteborg warehouse) secondary, Brattöns building materials
- Malmö: YLLW (Dalby 20 min) + Input primary, Rekomo (Malmö warehouse) secondary, Malmö Återbyggdepå building materials
- Finland: YLLW + Input (confirm Nordic delivery), Rekomo (Nordic service), ⚠️ Local Finnish needed for heavy materials
- Norge: YLLW + Input + Rekomo (all claim Nordic), Local Norwegian installation, ⚠️ Research local if significant work
- Danmark: ⚠️ RESEARCH NEEDED, Potentially Input Nordic, Contact Green Solution House

#### EXPECTED OUTCOMES TIMELINE

**Week 2:** Confirmed capabilities, fire testing documented, Finland logistics known, framework terms understood, bed co-development initiated

**Week 4:** Fire testing protocol operational, material passport ready, testing budget/timeline integrated

**Week 8:** Benchmark pricing established, supplier comparison clear, first project ready to quote

**Outcome:** Fyra can confidently bid Swedish hotel circular renovation projects with:
- Verified supply chain (YLLW + Input primary)
- Fire testing protocol (6-8 week timeline, 100-200k SEK/category budget)
- Pricing benchmarks (50-70% new for volume, 80-90% for premium)
- Geographic coverage (Stockholm/Göteborg/Malmö excellent, Finland feasible, Danmark/Norge addressable)

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:** "Fyra blir **den eneste nordiske hospitality-designeren** med:
1. Pre-vetted Tier 1 supplier partnerships
2. Systematic fire testing protocol
3. Material passport standards
4. Proven supply chain for 100+ room hotel scale

Ingen andre designer/arkitekt i Sverige/Norden har denne systematiske infrastrukturen for sirkulære hotellprosjekter = **immediate market differentiation**."

**JSON Status:** ❌ COMPLETELY MISSING

**Impact:** This is the entire strategic framework that makes the supplier data actionable. Without this, suppliers.json is just a directory, not an operational strategy.

## SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS

### What We Did Well
✅ Captured all main suppliers (9 of 9 Tier 1-2 suppliers)
✅ Core operational data comprehensive (location, services, capabilities)
✅ Hospitality readiness scoring preserved
✅ Project examples documented
✅ Contact information complete

### Critical Gaps to Address
❌ Missing 4 Tier 3 suppliers + 1 Danish manufacturer
❌ Norwegian/Danish/Finnish market context completely absent
❌ Knowledge gaps framework (25+ specific gaps) not captured
❌ Implementation roadmap (6 prioritized actions) missing
❌ Strategic framework (how to use suppliers together) absent
❌ 30+ detailed fields per supplier missing
❌ Metadata (confidence, verification, dates) not captured

### Recommended Next Steps

**PHASE 1 (Immediate - This Week):**
1. Add missing suppliers (DPJ, Malmö, Spirec, Mater)
2. Add tier classifications
3. Add critical warnings

**PHASE 2 (Short Term - Next 2 Weeks):**
4. Create market context files (Norway, Denmark, Finland)
5. Create knowledge gaps file
6. Create action priorities file
7. Create strategy framework file
8. Add supplier metadata fields

**PHASE 3 (Medium Term - Next Month):**
9. Expand all supplier fields (legal, service details, pricing)
10. Add use case guidance
11. Create comparison metadata
12. Build website strategy section

### Impact of Completing All Phases

**Current State:** Suppliers.json is a good **directory** (65-70% data capture)

**After All Phases:** Platform becomes a complete **operational system** with:
- Verified supplier intelligence (90%+ data capture)
- Nordic market expansion framework
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Implementation playbook
- Decision support tools
- Competitive differentiation analysis

**Result:** Fyra becomes "den eneste nordiske hospitality-designeren med systematisk infrastruktur for sirkulære hotellprosjekter = immediate market differentiation"

---

## CONCLUSION

The extraction captured the **core supplier directory well (65-70% completeness)** but **missed the strategic framework that makes it actionable (0-20% capture of strategic sections)**.

**The document is 40% supplier profiles, 60% strategic intelligence.**
**We captured 80% of the 40%, and 10% of the 60%.**

To transform this from a directory into an operational platform, prioritize:
1. **Adding strategic context** (markets, gaps, actions, strategy)
2. **Adding missing suppliers** (completeness)
3. **Enhancing supplier metadata** (trust/currency)
4. **Adding use case guidance** (decision support)

**Estimated effort to reach 90%+ completeness: 40-50 hours over 4-6 weeks**

**Audit Completed: 2025-11-08**
**Auditor: Claude Code (Comprehensive systematic review)**
**Methodology: Field-by-field comparison, section-by-section analysis, gap identification**
